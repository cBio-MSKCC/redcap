## redcap.py

    import redcap

    redcap.update_records(pid, list_of_fields_to_values, overwrite, return_content, verbose)

Updates any fields for a record included in the list_of_fields_to_values dictionary.  list_of_fields_to_values is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary containing the fields and their values for that item in the list.  Overwrite is turned ON by default, so blank values will overwrite any value stored in RedCap.  The record id MUST be included.  redcap_repeat_instrument and redcap_repeat_instance are required for repeat instruments.  All dates must be in Y-M-D format regardless of the format definition for the field.
